# Support

## Community Support
For community support using ROCK, we encourage you to check out the fine members over at the [RockNSM Community Site](https://community.rocknsm.io/). From there you'll be able to connect with other users of ROCK as well as the developers and maintainers of the project. This is by far the fastest way to connect with others as well as start to troubleshoot issues you may be experiencing.

## GitHub Issue
In the event that you identify an issue with the project, please feel free to log it using the [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/rocknsm/rock/issues) for the project.

Please be sure to include the contents of `/etc/rocknsm/rocknsm-buildstamp`.

## Commercial Support
If you are needing commercial support, either from a systems integration perspective, scaled deployment, or complex deployment scenarios, [Perched](https://www.perched.io) provides those services. Perched was formed by the creators and maintainers of the RockNSM project and is focused on helping teams deploy the platform.

Additionally, Perched has a wide-range of training and education offerings for incident response, threat hunting, and intelligence analysis teams.
