# How to Pitch In

ROCK is an open source project and would not be what it is without a community of
users and contributors. There are many ways to contribute, so take a look at how:


## General Support
For quick questions and deployment support, please join the
[RockNSM Community](https://community.rocknsm.io).


## Github Contribution

### Issues
Before you submit an issue please search the issue tracker, as there may already
be an issue for your problem and it's discussion might just solve things. We
want to resolve issues as soon as possible, but in order to do so please provide
as much detail about the environment and situation as possible.


### Pull Requests
In order to issue a PR, fork the project, make your changes, and add descriptive
messages to your commits (this is a mandatory requirement for your PR to be
considered). Submit a PR to the main [rock repo](https://github.com/rocknsm/rock).
If changes or additions are suggested, edit your fork and this will automatically
update your PR.
