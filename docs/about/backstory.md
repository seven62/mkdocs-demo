# Backstory

ROCK is a tool that was created to solve a problem that was realized several
years ago while engaged in real-world missions and training exercises. That
problem was that the pervasive network sensor platform at the time, had many
architectural and operational issues. It was built on an insecure platform, had
performance problems, and did not follow the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).

The origin of RockNSM can be traced back to the Fall of 2014 when a couple of
wide-eyed dreamers started working on their own solution while drinking whiskey
in a hotel room. The project developed from an on-mission hasty replacement, to
an all-in-one sensor solution, and now a more full featured analysis stack
capable of multi-node deployments.
